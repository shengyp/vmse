            <p class="context">Faced with the overwhelming amounts of data in the 24/7 stream of new articles appearing online, it is often helpful to consider only the key entities and concepts and their relationships. This is challenging, as relevant connections may be spread across a number of disparate articles and sources. In this paper, we present a system that extracts salient entities, concepts, and their relationships from a set of related documents, discovers connections within and across them, and presents the resulting information in a graph-based visualization. We rely on a series of natural language processing methods, including open-domain information extraction, a special filtering method to maintain only meaningful relationships, and a heuristic to form graphs with a high coverage rate of topic entities and concepts. Our graph visualization then allows users to explore these connections. In our experiments, we rely on a large collection of news crawled from the Web 
and show how connections within this data can be explored.

        <section class="para">
            <h3 class="para-title">How dose the system works?</h3>
            <p class="context">The objective of our system is to support the user in quickly finding salient connections and facts from a collection
                of news articles, with a beginner-friendly interactive visualization interface. Our system is componsed of
                three major components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fact extraction module</li>
                    <li>Fact filtering module</li>
                    <li>Conceptual graph construction module</li>
                </ul>
            <p class="context">In the following, we will give a concrete example to illustrate the intermediate result of our system.
            </p>
            <p class="context">By default, the system lists five predefined trending news topics, e.g. the Syria refugee crisis, Iran nuclear
                issue, Volkswagen scandal, US presidential election, and the Chinese cooperation with Sudan. For each topic,
                the user can select relevant high-frequency keywords. For example, the user select several topic keywords
                of US presidential election, the system shows a list of documents ranked by their weight as selected, in
 which we select the top-25 documents for further processing,they can be
        <a href="https://github.com/shengyp/Multi-Docs-semantics/tree/master/data/elections/documents">retrieved</a> from here.
            </p>
            <p class="context">We rely on a series of natural language processing methods that provided by the fact module, including open-domain information extraction and coreference resolution, to achieve this while accounting for linguistic phenomena, e.g., handling pronouns such as ''she''. While previous work on open information extraction has extracted large numbers of subject-predicate-object triples, our method attempts to maintain only those that are most likely to correspond to meaningful relationships. For above top-25 documents, we can obtain corresponding result as <a href="https://github.com/shengyp/Multi-Docs-semantics/tree/master/data/elections/extracted-facts">retrieved</a> from here.</p>
            <p class="context">This data can be filtered such that only the most salient connections are maintained. That is, a set of entities and concepts as nodes and their connections as links to mark and compatible after applying the filtering algorithm. The result of fact filtering module can be <a href="https://github.com/shengyp/Multi-Docs-semantics/blob/master/data/elections/filtering-facts">download</a> from here.
            </p>
            <p class="context">The annotators with NLP background employ a heuristic to merge these subgraphs that formed in fact filtering module to a full conceptual graph, it guarantees the connected component of 25 entities and concepts or less remains.</p>

                    While specific input texts can be supplied directly to our analysis engine, our system is designed to also work with large document collections that can then be searched for specific documents to be analysed. Our current setup uses a large collection of <a href="http://research.signalmedia.co/newsir16/signal-dataset.html">news articles</a> released by Signal Media. It consists of 734,488 news articles and 265,512 blog articles, in total around 1 million English-language articles, with an average article length of 405 words. The articles stem from a variety of news sources and were collected during a period of one month (1–30 September 2015).
